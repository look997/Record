Using [MediaRecorder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder) (work only on Firefox) and libs [wavesurfer.js](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js) and [requirejs](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs).

Better to use https. Without it, you must approve the "Allowing use the microphone," every time the "Start Recording".
To load the URL requires CORS and restrictions of mixed content.
